Hi , my name is Suchira.
Today i will take about my daily life in campus
I'll wake up everyday before 8:00a.m.
It's because from Sunday until Thursday except Tuesday i'll have to join class in the morning.
So , it's normal that i will wake up a little bit late in Tuesday
But , today is on Monday
Now, i'm on my introduction to programming and problem sloving class.
Prof.Madya Dr.Azman is my lecturer for this class.
I'm happy that i can understand with what he was teaching.
I hope i'll get more knowledge in programming with this class.
My last class for today is philosophy and contemporary issues at 4:00p.m.-5:30p.m.
6:30p.m. - Done rest and start study
8:30-10:30 - programming work
10:30 - spend time with social media
